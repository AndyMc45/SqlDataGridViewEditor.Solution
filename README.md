# SqlDataGridViewEditor.Solution
Edits SQL databases in a DataGridView
The program allows users without knowledge of SQL to edit an SQL database in a DataGridView.  The program also has a plugin interface.  I use this to add a transcript plugin that we use to create, update and print student transcripts. 
The main issue with an "no-sql" editor is how to handle foreign keys.  My foreign keys are all autoincrementing integers.  It is easy enough to allow show the user a list of all the primary keys (i.e. integers) in the foreign key's reference table and let them choose one. But the user doesn't know what row / object that new integer is.  To solve this, we define some of the columns in a table as "Display keys".  This display key(s) is a column(s) in the reference table that the user does understand. For example, the display key of a student might be the student's name; or there can be two students with the same name, we could use two columns - their name and the year they entered the schoo.  When a user wants to edit a foreign key, we show the user a dropdown list of all the display keys in the reference table and they choose one.
